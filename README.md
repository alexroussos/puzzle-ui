# Puzzle UI

A React App for solving various puzzles. This code is unlikely to be useful for anything because 1) all the interesting work happens behind the REST API it is using and 2) I am still learning React. It's just a place for me to host my code.

Live version: https://puzzles.roussos.world

Built on the API at https://api.roussos.world/letter-boxed

## Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using Node 14

## Notes to self
- `npm run build` 
- `serve -s build`
- `s3cmd sync ./build/* s3://puzzles.roussos.world`
